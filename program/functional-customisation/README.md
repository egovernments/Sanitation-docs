2\. Additional Builds: Urban-rural convergence is an initiative that aims to ensure access of sanitation services to all gram panchayats (GPs) via urban local bodies (ULBs) located closest to them. With efforts in implementing decentralised waste management across 114 ULBs as well as enabling the rural population to avail sanitation facilities from urban areas located nearby, eGov with CPR (post-field observations and research) decided to include gram panchayats in SUJOG FSSM as part of this initiative. See details of customisation [here](https://sanitation.digit.org/program/functional-customisation/product-requirement-document-prd).

3\. The following MDMS have been configured.

* Property-type
* Property Sub-type
* Slum Names
* GP List
* Village List
* FSTP details

4\. The following user categories/roles have been created:
