## Tests Executed

This refers to the execution of test cases to ensure they meet the pre-defined requirements and specifications. It is the execution of tests by running the system under test cases, and obtaining the actual results that can be compared with the expected results to determine whether the tests have passed or failed. This is the first cycle of test execution for MVP, which is performed manually. This test execution does not include automation testing.

| Test cycle number | Planned number of tests per cycle | Total number of tests executed | Total number of passed test cases | Passed percentage | Number of failed test cases | Failure percentage |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 10                | 10                                | 118                            | 118                               | 100               | 0                           | 0                  |

## Test Completion Matrix

After completion of testing, various matrices are collected to prepare the test reports. This includes the number of the test cases executed, and passed and failed. Pass implies that the test cases were, run and no defects or deficiencies were observed. Fail implies that the test procedure includes a defect, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements.

| Cases                            | Result |
| -------------------------------- | ------ |
| Total number of test cases       | 118    |
| Number of test cases executed    | 118    |
| Number of test cases passed      | 118    |
| Number of test cases failed      | 0      |
| Number of test cases pending     | 0      |
| Number of test cases in progress | 0      |
| Number of test cases blocked     | 0      |
| Number of test cases rejected    | 0      |
| Number of test cases deferred    | 0      |
| Number of active defects         | 0      |

## Defect Metrics

This can be used to find out the current status of the defects linked to the test cases. It includes the following:

* Showstopper defect can be described as a bug which stops/restricts the testing to move ahead with that specific functionality or module.
* Critical impact defect is a major disruption to the testing activity.
* High impact defect test result shows impairments on critical business functionalities.
* Medium impact defect test results show impairments on business functionalities.
* Low impact defect is an aesthetic problem, with only cosmetic defects.

| Priority    | Number of defects opened | Number of defects closed | Number of defects on hold | Number of defects rejected | Defects open at the end of the test phase |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Showstopper | 5                        | 5                        | 0                         | 0                          | 0                                         |
| Critical    | 11                       | 11                       | 0                         | 0                          | 0                                         |
| High        | 15                       | 15                       | 0                         | 0                          | 0                                         |
| Medium      | 5                        | 5                        | 0                         | 0                          | 0                                         |
| Low         | 45                       | 0                        | 0                         | 0                          | 0                                         |

## &#x20;Exit Criteria Status

This includes testing tasks to be completed before the current phase. The criteria includes completion of test cases execution, and capturing the actual results and logging defects. It specifies the conditions and requirements that are required to be achieved or fulfilled before the end of the software testing process.
