# DSO User Manual

The Desludging Operators or DSOs are responsible for initiating and completing action on the citizen requests for desludging services. The requests are routed to the respective DSOs by the urban local body (ULB) officials. The DSOs update the application status once the services are delivered and payments are collected.

DSOs can do the following:&#x20;

* [Assign vehicles for desludging services](dso-user-manual.md#assign-vehicles)
* [Decline service requests](dso-user-manual.md#decline-request)
* [Complete service requests](dso-user-manual.md#complete-request)
