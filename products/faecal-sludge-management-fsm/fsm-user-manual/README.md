# FSM User Manual

The DIGIT-Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) allows citizens to raise service requests for desludging and pay the fees for the service delivery online. For governing bodies and vendors, it makes service delivery easier and captures information end-to-end, ensuring waste pick up and its disposal at the correct treatment plant. Real-time tracking of service delivery, along with the availability of rich transactional data allow decision makers to ensure a better citizen service experience and promote a cleaner/healthier environment.

## Key Features

* Apply for desludging services
* Make payment for services
* Register desludging operators
* Update vehicle logs
