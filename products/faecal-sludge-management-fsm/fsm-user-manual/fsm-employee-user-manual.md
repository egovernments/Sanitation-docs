### Multiple Request Assignment to a Single Vehicle <a href="#multiple-request-assignment-to-a-single-vehicle" id="multiple-request-assignment-to-a-single-vehicle"></a>

In our previous versions, the FSM application was designed to service requests one after the other i.e., a different application could not be assigned to the vehicle until and unless the vehicle has completed servicing the previous request assigned to it.

We recognised that multiple applications are assigned to the vehicle and the driver optimises the logistics based on other factors that are not captured in the system like distance, type of road etc to service the request and closed them accordingly. So, by moving away from the FIFO model to allowing drivers/DSOs to making use of human intelligence, we now allow multiple service requests to be assigned to the same vehicle and be closed in randomised order.

The ULB employee with the Creator role, creates applications as and when the receive from the citizens.

The ULB employee with the Editor role, assigns multiple applications to the same DSO and subsequently to the same vehicle.

For example: let’s assume 15 requests were created. Of the 15, 10 requests were assigned to DSO 1 and 5 to DSO 2, and of the 10 assigned to DSO 1, 7 are assigned to Vehicle 1 and 3 are assigned to Vehicle 2.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-08-02 at 11.24.42 AM.png>)

After completing the service, the DSO/driver can close each request in the order they completed. The applications need not be closed sequentially.
