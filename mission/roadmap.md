The following modules and features are part of the product roadmap:

1. Treatment Quality Monitoring: The treatment quality module aims to set up a digital system to define, record and review parameters such as tests on the samples from treatment plants (TP) by enabling on-ground actors to record, review and compare test results (on samples from the treatment plant) in the system. The information will be delivered to relevant stakeholders to bring awareness and to take action. The system will allow for real-time automated monitoring (without human intervention), with IoT sensors. The following features will be provided as part of the module:&#x20;

* Plant registry
* Recording of lab testing results
* Dashboards to monitor quality
* Anomaly detection and alerts for deviation\


2. Calendaring/Scheduling: Desludging/emptying of septic tanks of certain commercial and institutional properties such as community toilets, temples, etc., is a scheduled activity and performed at regular intervals. These are usually scheduled by the urban local body (ULB), and assigned to a vendor who performs the service. In some cases, the ULB owns the vehicles and employs individuals, and these requests are served by them. The calendaring/scheduling functionality will allow for:&#x20;

* Automated scheduling of services&#x20;
* Tracking service delivery against scheduled services
* Tracking adherence to schedule

3. Sanitation Worker Welfare (v1.0)

Sanitation workers are an integral part of the waste management ecosystem. Currently, the product is limited to capturing only drivers that are involved in transportation of waste. As part of v1.0 of the sanitation worker welfare, we want to create a record of service delivery to provide enumeration and benefits to sanitation workers. This will include:

* Building a sanitation worker registry/database
* Mapping of vendor and sanitation workers
* Mapping sanitation workers and faccal sludge treatment plants (FSTPs)
* Assigning sanitation workers to service requests
* Capturing details of unregistered sanitation workers, if not available in the database

4. Vendor as a business user: There are multiple operating models across countries and waste streams. Private vendors contribute to service delivery in waste management across multiple service categories, such as request collection, transportation, or treatment plant management. We want to enhance the product by introducing vendors as business users. The following will be the scope:

* Integrating vendor registry from DIGIT in FSM
* &#x20;Mapping of vendors to multiple urban local bodies
* &#x20;Mapping vendors to multiple service categories &#x20;
* Vendor collecting payments from citizens based on service categories
